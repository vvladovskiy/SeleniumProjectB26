=====
- XPATH :
- How do you handle dynamic web elements?
- How do you handle web elements that has dynamic attribute value?
#1- We use xpath methods such as contains, starts-with, and ends-with.
- We locate the part of the attribute that is not dynamic, and use
that part within the xpath locators to locate the web element.
#2- We can locate the static (stable) parent or child web elements and
move from there.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
- How do we move from parent to direct child using xpath?
- We use "/" single slash to go to direct child.
- How do we move from parent to any child using xpath?
- We use "//" double slash to go to any child.
- How do we move from child to parent using xpath?
- We use "/.."
- This will take our locator to the parent of currently located web
element.
- What is the syntax with the indexing in xpath?
- How do we use indexes with xpath?
- //tagName[@attribute='value'][3]
- If we use indexes without paranthesis, this way will only work in
direct siblings.
- (//tagName[@attribute='value'])[3]
- If we use indexes with paranthesis, this way it will work and index
through the whole html page.

----------
findElement vs findElements()
- findElement
- returns single web element
- return type: WebElement (coming from Selenium)
- it will throw NoSuchElementException if it cannot find a web
element with given locator.
- findElementS:
- returns List of WebElements
- return type : List<WebElement>
- it will NOT throw exception, it will return empty list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
- driver.manage().timeouts().impilicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
- Basically this line will allow our driver to wait UP TO given time if
driver cannot immedieatly locate a web element.
- We write it one time, and it is applied to the whole driver session.
- Driver does not have to wait until 10 second is ended. If it finds the
web element before maybe in 2 second or 5 seconds it will continue with
execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
- checkboxes & radiobuttons
- How do you handle checkboxes and radio buttons using Selenium?
#1- We can click
#2- We can check if they are selected or not. --> - isSelected();
#3- We can check if they are enabled or not. --> isEnabled();
- isSelected(); --> if web element is selected, it will return true, if
not false.
- isEnabled(); --> if web element is enabled, it will return true, if not
false.
